        Come on, Harry, we wanna say Goodnight to you<br>
        <br>
        <b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
        Holding me back<br>
        Gravity's holdin' me back<br>
        I want you to hold out the palm of your hand<br>
        Why don`t we leave it at that?<br>
        Nothing to say<br>
        When everything gets in the way<br>
        Seems you cannot be replaced<br>
        And I am the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
        <br><br>
        <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
        In this world, it is just us<br>
        You know it is not the same as it was<br>
        In this world, it is just us<br>
        You know it is not the same as it was<br>
        As it was, as it was<br>
        You know its not the same<br>
        <br>
        <b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
        Answer the phone<br>
        Harry, youre no good alone<br>
        Why are you sitting at home on the floor?<br>
        What kind of pills are you on?<br>
        Ringing the bell<br>
        And nobodys coming to help<br>
        Your daddy lives by himself<br>
        He just wants to know that youre well, oh-oh-oh<br>
        <br>
        <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
        In this world, it is just us<br>
        You know it is not the same as it was<br>
        In this world, it is just us<br>
        You know it is not the same as it was<br>
        As it was, as it was<br>
        You know its not the same<br>
        <br>
        <b>[Bridge]</b><br>
        Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet<br>
        I dont wanna talk about the way that it was<br>
        Leave America, two kids follow her<br>
        I dont wanna talk about who's doin' it first<br>
        <br>
        <b>[Outro]</b><br>
        (Hey) As it was<br>
        You know it's not the same as it was'<br>
        As it was, as it was<br>
        </p>
